// asap:1. walking animaton based on EITHER instance variable keeping track of past actions
// OR just count requestanimationframe frames IDK
// 2. collisions and damage on chrono
// 3. bloody pool for death animation for both crono and monsters
// 4. functions with instance variables to track last lifetime of animation like the jumping tracers? or just a settimeout

// FUTURE:
// 1. show WPM somewhere need to keep track of time elapsed DONE
// 2. gameover reset the game 
// 3. animate attack from crono-- should he just teleport everywhere and use x-attack? OR HUGE ARC with MATH that he flies through SOMEWHAT SOLVED
// 4. how does crono lose? do monsters need to attack him he needs hp or soemthing or if more than 5monsters are alive at once he loses
// 5. make it feel more alive with actual edges that crono and monsters cant spawn/cross
// 6. monsters move randomly left and right to and fro, also spawn preferentially away from existing monsters??
// 7. animate random movement, walking, and standing so it doesnt look like crono is skating
// 8. options/welcome screen/ choosing difficulty such as spawn rate
// 9. animate monster death
// 10. glitch: moving down+left double animates  SOLVED
// 11. maybe huge melee limit break swing but will take a lot of either async/instance variables tracking/animationframes counting
